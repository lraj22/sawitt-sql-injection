				Sawitt is a new social media website that allows users to share media, as
				the name "social media" suggests. Due to the fact that it was created in
				December 2023, and it has not been very long since then, the features are not very
				good, there may be bugs, &amp; you may not like the features, or lacks thereof.

				Though this may seem like an ordinary social media website, there are differences from
				other social media websites. This website specifically, can be not secure. You
				should not use this website for actual social purposes on the not secure
				version. It is very highly recommended that if using the not secure version,
				please use fake information. However, if you use the immune version, you
				should be fine, as it is secure. The type of not secure: SQL Injection.
